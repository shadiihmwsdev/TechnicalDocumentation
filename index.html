                  JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                  is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                  example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                  its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                  and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
                  structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                  variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                  example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                    to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                    client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                    HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                    and page navigation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                    relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                    extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                    provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
                    the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
                first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                <code
                  >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                  greetMe("World");
                </code>
          
                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                browser!

            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
                names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
              </p>
              <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
                JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
                "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
              </p>
              <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
                You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
                identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                _name.

            <article>
                You can declare a variable in three ways:
                <p>
                  With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
                  can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
                  always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
                  warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
                  can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
                  below.
                </p>
              </article>
        </section>
           
        <section id="Global_Variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Global Variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                  Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
                  pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
                  variables using the window.variable syntax.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or
                  frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame
                  name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
                  document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
                  parent.phoneNumber.
